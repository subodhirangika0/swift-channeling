Abstract

Our goal is to build a program that will replace the existing system that is in place for the online channeling of Doctors. Our program will solve the major issue of how slow or less organized the current system in place is. 
The program we are building eliminates the unknown waiting times for patients and streamlines the process of a patient waiting and meeting their doctor. Even though the existing system for online channeling may be considered as new technology, we believe we can greatly improve the system as we can work on the many shortcomings that are present within the system.
